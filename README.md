# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for training a neural network to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Description

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple feedforward neural network to classify these images using TensorFlow.

## Getting Started
